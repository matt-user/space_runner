# TODO
have mall fighter shoot two bullets
more accurate targeting
change bullet animation depending on angle of shot
have enemy bullets kill player (might not want this for testing purposes)

Problem:
Too hard to hit floater enemies
Solution:
Increase bullet or enemy size

Problem:
I think all sprites are too small.  Screen feels empty
