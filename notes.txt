# TODO Eventually
The rotation and firing are things to be done only if I decide I want that movement
Rotation:
    once the player reaches the point I don't want to rotate the player to face the top
    I want the player to rotate to face the point
Firing:
    the projectile fires from the midtop of the sprite
    when the player rotates however this doesn't fire from the correct position on the sprite
get the physics of the movement right
set the mouse image

fix hitboxes
build whole first level

# TODO Possibly
Problem:
Too hard to hit floater enemies
Solution:
Increase bullet or enemy size

Problem:
I think all sprites are too small.  Screen feels empty
